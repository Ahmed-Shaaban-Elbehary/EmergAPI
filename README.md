# Emergancy System

My graduation project, completed in 2018 with my favorite team, involved the use of several technologies such as MS SQL, Entity Framework, ASP.NET MVC, and RESTful APIs to develop a mobile application. The idea behind our project was to provide assistance to people based on their specific conditions or situations. This project provided me with extensive knowledge and experience in these technologies, and I am eager to share my understanding of how they work.
